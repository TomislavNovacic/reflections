How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It pinpointed me the diffs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

we can easily see where we made mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros are that you choose when to commit, and that are also the cons because we can choose wrong time to commit. Versioning automaticly is good when we dont know when is the right time to commmit, on the other hand it can be to often.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because in coding changes in one files can affect others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log list all the commits and git diff shows the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

it gives me a safe zone.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for my diploma thesis.
